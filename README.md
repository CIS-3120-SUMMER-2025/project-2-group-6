# project-2-group-6
Contributor: Ian

Task
	•	Scraped a table with at least 30 rows (most populated cities).
	•	Cleaned the data and stored it in DF1.
	•	Exported DF1 as a CSV file.

Deliverables
	•	DF1.csv – cleaned dataset from the scraped table.
	•	scraping/ folder contains the scraping code used.

Notes
	•	Data was scraped using Python (BeautifulSoup, pandas).
	•	Only minimal cleaning was required (removing null values and formatting).
	•	The CSV is ready for use in the API and merging steps in later parts of the project.
